## Aircraft Conflict Detection and Resolution

Following paper have been implemented and tested: *Alonso-Ayuso A, Escudero L, Martin-Campo J and Mladenovic N, "A VNS metaheuristic for solving the aircraft conflict detection and resolution problem by performing turn changes", Journal of Global Optimization, 2015.*

### Problem Definition

The aircraft Conflict Detection and Resolution problem (CDR) in air traffic management consists of finding a new configuration for a set
of aircraft such that conflict situations between them are avoided. A conflict situation arises if two or more aircraft violate the
safety distances that they must maintain in flight.
